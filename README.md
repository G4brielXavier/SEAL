# SEAL

SEAL is a minimalist and experimental note-taking editor, created as an authorial project to explore ideas of structured writing, creative limitations, and simple data architecture.

It doesn't try to be Notion, nor a complete editor.
In fact, it **hates you a little** — and that's on purpose.

## ✨ Idea

SEAL was born as an experiment.
The idea is to write with less comfort, less distraction, and more intention.

No thousand formats.
No excessive customization.
No trying to please.

It's writing almost as if it were in stone.

## 🧠 Concepts

- Direct and raw writing
- Simple data-driven structure
- Focus on content, not aesthetics
- Project conceived more as a study and portfolio than a final product

## 🚧 Status

🟡 Project closed/frozen  

SEAL is not in active development.
It remains online only as a technical and conceptual demonstration.

## 🌐 Demo

## 📦 Technologies

- Web (frontend)
- Simple data structure (JSON)
- Deploy via Vercel

## 📌 Note

This project exists primarily as:
- A creative experiment
- A record of ideas
- A portfolio item

The current focus of development is shifting to other projects, such as the **Hova** DSL.
