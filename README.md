# SEAL

**SEAL** is a minimal writing tool.
Write. Seal. Leave it untouched.

**SEAL** is a small web app create for **personal writing and notes** where text is treated as something
intencional - not endlessly editable

Once a text is **sealed**, it becomes read-only.
No formatting wars. No cloud. No noise.

### What is SEAL?

SEAL is not a note app. <br>
SEAL is not Notion. <br>
SEAL is not a markdown editor. <br>

**SEAL** is a **personal writing space** inspired by the ideia of writing on stone:
- you write carefully
- you seal when done
- you don't rewrite history

### Core concept

SEAL follows a simple ritual:
1. Write
2. Seal
3. Read

After sealing:
- the text cannot be edited
- only read
- the act of sealing give weight to what was written

### Sealed Text

- Sealed texts are immutable
- No markdown
- No formatting
- No AI assistance
- No cloud sync

This is intentional

SEAL values **finality**, not productivity metrics.

### Storage

- Data is storage **locally in the browser**
- No backend
- No accounts
- No tracking

SEAL is designed primarily for **personal use**.

### Tech Stack
- Vite
- React
- CSS (no UI framework)
- LocalStorage
- Zustand

### Purpose

SEAL was built as:
- a personal tool
- a UX/interaction experiment
- a portfolio project

It explores restraint, intentional design, and the ideia that **not everything should be editable forever.**

### Status

SEAL is considered **v1.0** - **Concept complete**.

No active roadmap.
No promised features.

### Final Note

SEAL is not for everyone.

It exists for those who believe that
**writing sometimes deserves to be left untouched.**
